  **NOTE:** If you don't have the PhoneGap Developer App, you can still run the app in your browser by opening the `index.html` file in the browser, you will just have limited
  functionality.

- Spend a moment trying out the app, ensuring it looks like what you see below:

>You should use your browser developer tools at any time during this workshop to help debug any issues. In Chrome you can access them with **Alt+Cmd+I** or via the **View->Developer** menu.

### PhoneGap Developer App Tips
When viewing your apps with the PhoneGap Developer app, you should be aware of the following gestures:

- Use a *4 finger* tap to force your app to refresh
- Use a *3 finger* tap to go to the home screen
