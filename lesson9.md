## Next Steps
Now that you've got a basic app up and running you may be looking for additional information on where to proceed. This module is meant to share some useful resources for taking your app development process to the next level.

### Testing, Profiling
You'll want to find tools for helping you test and debug your apps. You should also look at using a tool to measure performance metrics. Here are some
links to tools and resources that can help you further:

  - [PhoneGap App Performance Testing Repo](https://github.com/blefebvre/pg-app-perf) - Bruce Lefebvre (spoke at PhoneGap Day EU 2016)
  - [browser-perf](https://github.com/axemclion/browser-perf) - a node based tool that measures various performance metrics of a web page or hybrid application via the browser (Chrome, Firefox, IE)
  - [Remote Debugging on Android](http://geeklearning.io/apache-cordova-and-remote-debugging-on-android/)
  - [Debugging with Safari Web Inspector](http://phonegap-tips.com/articles/debugging-ios-phonegap-apps-with-safaris-web-inspector.html)

### Securing your App

### Plugin Development  
There are a vast number of plugins currently available for Cordova but you still may find yourself needing a specific native feature that is not already
  supported. Learn how to write your own plugin below.

### App Submission (provisioning, code signing, submitting to app stores)
- Attend **App Submission** workshop by Shazron Abdullah at 5pm today!
- Check out this [useful guide to App Submission](https://github.com/timkim/phonegap-day-workshop-app-submission/wiki) built by the PhoneGap Team.  

### Adding Analytics
Analytics can be used to determine how your app is being used, which features are popular and where your pain points are.

### Updating your App (Over the Air Updates)
Update your apps in the iOS App Store quickly without waiting on long approval processes using over the air updates. Use the following links as potential resources:

- [Code Push Plugin (using MS CodePush Service)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-code-push)
- [Hot Code Cordova Push Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-code-push) and [associated CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-hot-code-push-cli)     
- [Learn how exFM did it](http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/04/23/story-behind-exfm/) (read the section titled *Loading Assets*).        
- [Ionic Deploy](http://docs.ionic.io/docs/deploy-from-scratch) service

### A/B Testing
Experiment with your app and see what works best. Change colors, layout, images, marketing copy or whatever you want to test to
  understand the impact of the change by using an A/B testing service.

Below are some plugins for services supporting PhoneGap apps:  

- [Optimizely Cordova Plugin](https://github.com/optimizely/optimizely-cordova-plugin)
- [Leanplum Cordova Plugin](https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/Leanplum/blob/master/doc/index.md)
